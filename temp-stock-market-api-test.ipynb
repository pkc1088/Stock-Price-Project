Click here to access exclusive investment research and ad free browsing!Our #1 AI Stock Pick is on a steep discount - 29.99$ instead of 99.99$! Click here to access exclusive research!We recently published a list of 11 Best Safe Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against other best safe stocks to buy according to hedge funds.In times when you never know what you’ll wake up to the next morning, playing safe seems to be the wisest choice. Amid consistent market shifts and global uncertainties, it’s difficult not to lean towards reliability. With rising global recession risks and political uncertainties, protecting the capital has become a priority for many. As Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, once said,“The idea of investing in a company just because it’s safe is not necessarily a good idea. But it’s a much better idea than investing in something that is clearly risky.”If we think about a “safe” stock, a low-risk stock usually comes to our mind. While it’s true, there is even more to it. A safe stock generally stems from a well-established company possessing a strong balance sheet, a track record of decent performance, solid market positioning, and a dividend history. So, when looking for a safe stock, it’s important to look for not one, not two, but all of these metrics. In its entirety, these are usually “blue chip stocks” that are market leaders in the industries they operate.Hedge funds, recognized for their strategies and in-depth market understanding, have long advocated for such stocks for their reliability and resilience. These managers carefully study the market trends and then weigh in on businesses that are deemed to deliver both value and predictability.As reported by Reuters, hedge funds are fleeing the stocks of companies that are providing what customers want, and what they don’t need. As the signs of a global recession are becoming more and more evident, hedge funds are dumping their positions in consumer discretionary. “Hedge funds dumping consumer discretionary stocks strongly suggests they’re bracing for economic trouble, likely a recession,” mentioned Bruno Schneller, the Managing Director at Erlen Capital Management.Similarly, a Goldman Sachs report, comparing the gains by Hedge Fund VIP basket and the broader market, indicates that the top 50 stocks preferred by hedge funds have collectively returned 10% in 2025 relative to the market’s 3% gain.In a “Low-Risk Stocks Outperform within All Observable Markets of the World” paper by Nardin Baker and Robert Haugen, the differences in performance by low-volatility stocks and high-volatility stocks in developed and emerging equity markets worldwide were compared. The results revealed that stocks with low realized volatility exhibit higher future returns at lower risk than stocks with relatively higher realized volatility, thus contradicting the traditional inference that attributes higher returns to higher risks. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best safe stocks to consider.In compiling a list of the 11 best safe stocks to buy according to hedge funds, we used Insider Monkey’s database of over 1,000 hedge funds, as of Q4 2024, and picked mega-cap stocks with positive five-year returns and next-year revenue growth. All of these factors are considered to ensure that the stocks selected yield low volatility and high safety. In addition, we also considered stocks that pay dividends to shareholders to ensure safety and reliability. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the hedge funds having stakes in them.At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).A customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.Number of Hedge funds holding: 339Forward Dividend: $0Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a leading online retailer widely recognized for its e-commerce, cloud computing, and digital streaming services. Incepted in 1994, the company operates through three segments: North America, International, and Amazon Web Services (AWS). The giant mainly serves developers, consumers, advertisers, employees, and enterprises.Behind Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) as a solid case is the current price level. With the stock trading lower, analysts consider it a buying opportunity, especially given its huge AI and robotic investments that are at the forefront of what’s next. While the short-term position of the company shows a somewhat blurred picture, the long-term efficiency gains are quite evident when considering its footing in AI, fueling a robotics paradigm shift.The 750,000 mobile robots and several thousand robotic arms in its warehouses highlight that such a vision is already coming to life. These initiatives are anticipated to generate as much as $10 billion in savings annually over a 5-year time period. When we say Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is all-in on AI capability, we’re not exaggerating. The cloud unit of the e-commerce powerhouse has unveiled new AI chips and foundation models, and all of this is done to attract AI developers.And here’s the best part. Jeff Bezos, the CEO of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), is apparently overseeing the development of 1,000 internal AI applications at Amazon and the enhancement of AWS’s AI infrastructure. The company’s $8 billion investment in Anthropic and the joint development of a supercomputer for AI training speak about its aggressive efforts to gain an edge in high-end AI services.The one-year price target of $248.71 translates to an upside of more than 40%. In general, analysts, when providing the price targets for Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), are confident about the bright and thriving future of the company. For investors valuing long-haul gains, AMZN is a smart and secure pick.Overall, AMZN ranks 1st on our list of best safe stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of safe stocks, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about this cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires.Disclosure: None.

      "Energy Transfer\n",
      "\n",
      "Energy Transfer (NYSE: ET) operates one of the largest integrated midstream systems in the country, with various pipeline, storage, and processing assets. The company is particularly well positioned in and around the Permian Basin, which is the most prolific oil basin in the U.S. with some of the lowest breakevens. While operators drill the basin for oil, the wells also produce a lot of associated natural gas. Due to flaring (burning of natural gas) regulations, this gas must be transported and find a home, which, due to its abundance, leads to some of the cheapest regional prices in the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "Access to this cheap natural gas gives Energy Transfer a lot of growth project opportunities. It significantly increased its growth capital expenditures (capex) from $3 billion in 2024 to $5 billion in 2025. One of its keystone projects is the Hugh Brinson Pipeline, which will take gas away from the Permian to support growing power demand in Texas stemming from AI. It has also signed its first contract directly with a data center developer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Energy Transfer's robust project backlog sets it up for solid growth in the coming years. Meanwhile, the stock carries an attractive 7.9% yield with a well-covered distribution that it plans to grow at a 3% to 5% rate moving forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "Enterprise Products Partners\n",
      "\n",
      "A model of consistency, Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE: EPD) has increased its distribution for 26 straight years. Like Energy Transfer, the company is also well positioned in the Permian and has ramped up its growth capex. It plans to spend between $4 billion and $4.5 billion in growth projects this year, up from $3.9 billion a year ago and only $1.6 billion in 2022.\n",
      "\n",
      "Enterprise currently has $7.6 billion in growth projections under construction, of which $6 billion are slated to come online at some point this year. That should help its growth both this year and next year. Most of these projects are centered around the Permian Basin....\n",
      "\n",
      "2. URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/origin-bancorp-inc-obk-among-133053907.html\n",
      "Text (first 200 chars): In contrast, the global insurance sector is dealing with economic turbulence, high inflation, and unpredictable interest rates. Personal property and casualty insurance grew 9.5% between 2022-2023, reaching $1.1 trillion, driven mostly by rate increases rather than new businesses. Thus, the sector is focused on innovation and geographic diversification, expanding into emerging Asian and Latin American markets. At the same time, in the U.S., affordability concerns are forcing insurers and other sectors to cut costs and improve their digital services.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking ahead, financial companies stand strong to gain from the revival in financial markets, as recent forecasts indicate M&A activity, buyouts, and private lending picking up steam in 2025. Furthermore, companies are making strategic deals and investing in AI technology, fueling rapid growth in private markets. Additionally, private credit assets under management could double soon, as more businesses and individuals seek financing outside traditional banks. This surge in deals and fundraising follows several quiet years and sets up major financial players for solid profits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite brief macroeconomic uncertainty, the U.S. economy improved more than expected in 2024, with GDP growth hitting about 2.7%. Although the progress is expected to slow down in 2025, with growth likely dropping to around 1.5%, the financial sector is holding strong, supported by expected Fed rate cuts, steadier regulations, and a comeback in market activity. Moreover, record consumer debt of $17.7 trillion and increasing corporate refinancing needs are expected to affect borrowing patterns.\n",
      "\n",
      "The global financial industry includes banking, insurance, asset management, and capital market sectors, and plays a significant role in supporting economic activity. According to McKinsey, the banking industry handles assets worth $400 trillion as of 2025, bringing in about $7 trillion and $1.1 trillion in annual revenue and profits, respectively. On the other hand, the broader financial services sector is on the high, increasing more than 16% in the last year (as of writing this article), beating the broader market’s 6% return for the same period. This robust growth is expected to continue throughout the remainder of 2025, with the momentum driven by dropping interest rates, cooling off inflation, and investors’ faith in the sector, creating upside potential across various segments.\n",

      "\n",
      "Story Continues\n",
      "\n",
      "As such, innovation and digital transformation drive the financial sector, as banks alone have poured over $600 billion into tech upgrades, outspending even tech companies on IT, as reported by McKinsey. Despite this massive investment, labor productivity has dropped 4% over the last 15 years. This troubling decline has created pressure to make these tech investments pay off. Looking ahead, as AI, automation, and cloud are getting adopted, companies are expected to transform their business models and enhance digital services to boost efficiency and customer reach.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, new tariff policies are shaking up global markets, further triggering the macroeconomic uncertainty. Billionaire Ken Fisher is still critical of these measures as he argues that it is unnecessary to worry about them. He posted the following statement on X.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What Trump unveiled on Wednesday is stupid, wrong, arrogantly extreme, ignorant trade-wise and addressing a non-problem with misguided tools. It will fade and fail and the fear is bigger than the problem, which from here is bullish.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He strongly believes financial stocks may bounce back once the initial shock passes by, drawing a historical parallel: “It may well be this goes something like the 1998 stock market correction leading to a 26% annual return.” As interest rates drop and economic pressures ease, investors are eyeing financial companies for potential recovery gains and strategic long-term positions.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "To compile this list, we reviewed Ken Fisher’s SEC Q4 2024 13F filings. We picked 10 stocks that have the highest upside potential from their current levels as of April 22.

      "For Q4 ended December 31, 2024, Origin Bancorp, Inc. (NYSE:OBK) posted $0.46 diluted EPS. Its net interest margin grew by 15 basis points to 3.33%, beating forecasts, while the company is aiming for 3.45% NIM by late 2025. Additionally, loan growth should reach mid-to-high single digits in 2025, a change from its cautious 2024 strategy. Moreover, non-interest expenses should stay flat or drop slightly, reinforcing operational leverage.\n",
      "\n",
      "The company’s “Optimize Origin” plan involves closing branches, reshaping teams, and cleaning up its balance sheet. These moves should add $21 million to annual earnings on a pretax, pre-provision basis. Origin Bancorp, Inc. (NYSE:OBK) has already closed eight branches, bought back $70 million in debt, and slashed brokered deposits by 81% in Q4. Its loan-to-deposit ratio sits at a healthy 87.9%, and the company is handling credit quality well.\n",

      "The Ken Fisher Stock Portfolio includes Origin Bancorp, Inc. (NYSE:OBK), representing trust in its potential. As OBK approaches $10 billion in assets in 2025, it continues to broaden its Southeast imprint in Alabama and Florida with loan and deposit growth. The company’s focus on lasting profits makes it stand out among finance stocks with growth potential.\n",

      "Overall, OBK ranks 7th on our list of billionaire Ken Fisher’s finance stock picks with huge upside potential. While we acknowledge the potential of OBK as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

      "Text (first 200 chars): In contrast, the global insurance sector is dealing with economic turbulence, high inflation, and unpredictable interest rates. Personal property and casualty insurance grew 9.5% between 2022-2023, reaching $1.1 trillion, driven mostly by rate increases rather than new businesses. Thus, the sector is focused on innovation and geographic diversification, expanding into emerging Asian and Latin American markets. At the same time, in the U.S., affordability concerns are forcing insurers and other sectors to cut costs and improve their digital services.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking ahead, financial companies stand strong to gain from the revival in financial markets, as recent forecasts indicate M&A activity, buyouts, and private lending picking up steam in 2025. Furthermore, companies are making strategic deals and investing in AI technology, fueling rapid growth in private markets. Additionally, private credit assets under management could double soon, as more businesses and individuals seek financing outside traditional banks. This surge in deals and fundraising follows several quiet years and sets up major financial players for solid profits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite brief macroeconomic uncertainty, the U.S. economy improved more than expected in 2024, with GDP growth hitting about 2.7%. Although the progress is expected to slow down in 2025, with growth likely dropping to around 1.5%, the financial sector is holding strong, supported by expected Fed rate cuts, steadier regulations, and a comeback in market activity. Moreover, record consumer debt of $17.7 trillion and increasing corporate refinancing needs are expected to affect borrowing patterns.\n",
      "\n",
      "The global financial industry includes banking, insurance, asset management, and capital market sectors, and plays a significant role in supporting economic activity. According to McKinsey, the banking industry handles assets worth $400 trillion as of 2025, bringing in about $7 trillion and $1.1 trillion in annual revenue and profits, respectively. On the other hand, the broader financial services sector is on the high, increasing more than 16% in the last year (as of writing this article), beating the broader market’s 6% return for the same period. This robust growth is expected to continue throughout the remainder of 2025, with the momentum driven by dropping interest rates, cooling off inflation, and investors’ faith in the sector, creating upside potential across various segments.\n",

      "We recently published a list of Billionaire Ken Fisher’s 10 Finance Stock Picks with Huge Upside Potential . In this article, we are going to take a look at where SouthState Corporation (NYSE:SSB) stands against other billionaire Ken Fisher’s finance stock picks with huge upside potential.\n",

      "Story Continues\n",
      "\n",
      "As such, innovation and digital transformation drive the financial sector, as banks alone have poured over $600 billion into tech upgrades, outspending even tech companies on IT, as reported by McKinsey. Despite this massive investment, labor productivity has dropped 4% over the last 15 years. This troubling decline has created pressure to make these tech investments pay off. Looking ahead, as AI, automation, and cloud are getting adopted, companies are expected to transform their business models and enhance digital services to boost efficiency and customer reach.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, new tariff policies are shaking up global markets, further triggering the macroeconomic uncertainty. Billionaire Ken Fisher is still critical of these measures as he argues that it is unnecessary to worry about them. He posted the following statement on X.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What Trump unveiled on Wednesday is stupid, wrong, arrogantly extreme, ignorant trade-wise and addressing a non-problem with misguided tools. It will fade and fail and the fear is bigger than the problem, which from here is bullish.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He strongly believes financial stocks may bounce back once the initial shock passes by, drawing a historical parallel: “It may well be this goes something like the 1998 stock market correction leading to a 26% annual return.” As interest rates drop and economic pressures ease, investors are eyeing financial companies for potential recovery gains and strategic long-term positions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our Methodology\n",
      "\n",
      "To compile this list, we reviewed Ken Fisher’s SEC Q4 2024 13F filings. We picked 10 stocks that have the highest upside potential from their current levels as of April 22. Finally, we ranked the stocks in ascending order based on their highest analyst upside potential, while also laying out hedge fund sentiment for these stocks according to Insider Monkey’s Q4 2024 database.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n",

Its interest margin improved to 3.48%, boosting interest income by $18 million compared to the previous quarter. Throughout 2024, loans increased by 5% and deposits rose by 3%. Furthermore, the company’s non-interest income hit $80 million in Q4, while it improved efficiency by 140 basis points to 54.4%. In addition, return on assets reached 1.27% for the quarter.\n",

It expects to save $45 million this year through the deal, reaching $90 million in savings by 2026. SouthState also sold and leased back 170 branches, freeing up $225 million for growth opportunities.\n",

      "Looking ahead, SouthState Corporation (NYSE:SSB) expects its net interest margin (NIM) to increase to 3.75%-3.85% by late 2025, with steady mid-single-digit loan growth. It is also pushing to expand in key markets, such as Florida, Texas, and the Carolinas, while cutting expenses to around $340-350 million by the end of 2025.

      "During last year's presidential campaign, Donald Trump constantly repeated his intention to bring about dramatic change as soon as he returned to the White House.\n",
      "But few expected it to come at such breakneck speed.\n",
      "In the three months since he took the oath of office, the 47th president has deployed his power in a way that compares to few predecessors.\n",
      "In stacks of bound documents signed off with a presidential pen and policy announcements made in all caps on social media, his blizzard of executive actions has reached into every corner of American life.\n",
      "To his supporters, the shock-and-awe approach has been a tangible demonstration of an all-action president, delivering on his promises and enacting long-awaited reforms.\n",
      "But his critics fear he is doing irreparable harm to the country and overstepping his powers - crippling important government functions and perhaps permanently reshaping the presidency in the process.\n",
      "Here are six turning points from the first 100 days.\n",
      "For once, it wasn't a Trump social media post that sparked an outcry.\n",
      "Three weeks into the new term, at 10.13am on a Sunday morning, Vice-President JD Vance wrote nine words that signalled a strategy which has since shaped the Trump administration's second term.\n",
      "\"Judges aren't allowed to control the executive's legitimate power,\" he declared on X.\n",
      "In the media frenzy that followed, legal experts lined up to challenge that assertion, pointing to a 220-year-old principle which lies at the heart of American democracy.\n",
      "Courts have the power to check and strike down any government action - laws, regulations and executive orders - they think violates the US Constitution.\n",
      "Vance's words represented a brazen challenge to judicial authority and, more broadly, the system of three co-equal branches of government crafted by America's founders.\n",
      "But Trump and his team remain unapologetic in extending the reach of the executive branch into the two other domains - Congress and the courts.\n",
      "The White House has moved aggressively to wrest control of spending from Congress, unilaterally defunding programmes and entire agencies.\n",
      "This erosion of its power has been largely met by silence on Capitol Hill, where Trump's Republicans hold slim majorities in both chambers.\n",
      "The courts have been more resistant, with well over 100 rulings so far halting presidential actions they deem to be unconstitutional, according to a tally by the New York Times.\n",
      "Some of the biggest clashes have been over Trump's immigration crackdown. In March, more than 200 Venezuelans deemed a danger to the US, were deported to El Salvador, many under sweeping wartime powers and without the usual process of evidence being presented in court.\n",
      "A Republican-appointed judge on a federal appeals court said he was \"shocked\" by how the White House had acted.\n",
      "\"Now the branches come too close to grinding irrevocably against one another in a conflict that promises to diminish both,\" Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson wrote.\n",
      "Trump and White House officials have said they will obey court rulings, even as the president lambasts many of the judges who issue them and the administration at times moves slowly to fully comply.\n",
      "It all amounts to a unique test of a constitutional system that for centuries has operated under a certain amount of good faith.\n",
      "While Trump has been at the centre of this push, one of his principal agents of chaos is a man who wasn't born in the US, but who built a business empire there.\n",
      "Elon Musk, dressed in black from head to toe and wearing sunglasses, stood centre stage and basked in the adulation of the Conservative Political Action Conference crowd.\n",
      "The richest man in the world, who wants to cut trillions of dollars from the federal government, said he had a special surprise.\n",
      "Argentinian President Javier Milei, known for his own budget-slashing, emerged from backstage and handed him a shiny gold chainsaw.\n",
      "\"This is the chainsaw for bureaucracy,\" Musk exclaimed. \"CHAINSAW!!\"\n",
      "It was a dramatic illustration not only of Musk's enthusiasm for his \"Department of Government Efficiency\" (Doge) assignment, but also of the near rock-star status that the South African-born technologist has developed among the Trump faithful.\n",
      "Since that appearance, Musk has dispatched his operatives across the federal government, pushing to access sensitive government databases and identify programmes to slash.\n",
      "Although he has not come anywhere near to finding the trillions of dollars of waste he once promised, his cuts have drastically reduced dozens of agencies and departments - essentially shutting down the US Agency for International Development (USAID) and attempting to dismantle the Department of Education.\n",
      "While pledges to cut \"waste, fraud and abuse\" in government and trim the ballooning federal deficit typically have broad appeal, the manner in which Musk has used his metaphorical chainsaw has led to conflict with senior government officials and stoked anger among some of the American public.\n",
      "Some Trump supporters may approve of the administration's aggressive budget-cutting but other constituents have berated Republican legislators at town hall events.\n",
      "Hecklers have expressed fear that the cuts will adversely affect popular government programmes like Social Security retirement plans, veterans benefits, and health insurance coverage for the poor and elderly.\n",
      "Their concerns may not be entirely misplaced, given that these schemes make up the bulk of federal spending.\n",
      "If these programmes are not cut back, sweeping tax cuts that Trump has promised would further increase the scale of US government debt and put at risk arguably his biggest election promise - economic prosperity.\n",
      "When trader Richard McDonald saw Trump hold up his charts in the White House Rose Garden showing a list of countries targeted by US tariffs, he knew he had to act fast.\n",
      "\"I jumped to my feet because I wasn't expecting a board [of charts] - I was expecting an announcement,\" he says.\n",
      "McDonald expected tariff cuts of 10% or 20%, but says \"nobody expected these huge numbers\".\n",
      "He raced to understand which companies might be worst hit. Then he sold.\n",
      "\"There are billions being wiped off share prices every second, so it's really 'fastest finger first'.\"\n",
      "He is one of the many traders who were at the coal face of global markets when share prices plunged everywhere following Trump's so-called \"Liberation Day\" tariff announcement.\n",
      "The S&P 500 index of the largest firms listed in the US was hit particularly hard - and even though the White House has reversed course on some of the highest tariffs, it hasn't fully recovered since.\n",
      "The economy was the biggest concern for US voters in November's election, and Trump rode a tide of deep unhappiness over Biden's handling of inflation all the way to victory.\n",
      "His pledge to cut prices, pare back government regulation and boost homegrown industry was a pro-business message warmly welcomed on Wall Street and by many working Americans.\n",
      "But as Trump tries to follow through on his promise of new tariffs, the economic costs, at least in the short term, have become painfully apparent.\n",
      "The stock market is sinking, interest rates - including for home mortgages - are rising, and consumer confidence is down. Unemployment is also ticking up, in part due to the growing number of federal employees forced out of their jobs.\n",
      "The Federal Reserve Bank, along with economic experts, warn Trump's plan will shrink economic growth and possibly lead to a recession.\n",
      "While the president's approval ratings on his handling of the economy have tumbled, many of his supporters are sticking with him. And in former industrial areas hollowed out by the loss of manufacturing jobs, there are hopes that tariffs could even the global playing field.\n",
      "\"Trump has earned back the respect,\" says truck driver Ben Maurer in Pennsylvania, referring to tariffs on China. \"We are still the force to be reckoned with.\"\n",
      "Economic concerns have contributed to Trump's overall decline in the polls, but in one key area, he is still largely on solid ground in the public's eye - immigration.\n",
      "\"It's him! It's him! I recognise his features,\" says Myrelis Casique Lopez, pointing at a photo of men shackled and cuffed on the floor of one of the most infamous prisons in the world.\n",
      "She had spotted her son in the image, taken from above, of a sea of shaven heads belonging to men in white T-shirts sat in long, straight rows.\n",
      "At home in Maracay, Venezuela, Ms Casique was shown the photograph, first shared online by the El Salvador authorities, by a BBC reporter.\n",
      "When she last had contact with her son, he was in the US and facing deportation to Venezuela but now he was 1,430 miles (2,300 km) away from her, one of 238 men sent by US authorities to a notorious mega-jail in El Salvador.\n",
      "The Trump administration says they are members of the Tren de Aragua gang - a powerful, multi-national crime operation - but Ms Casique insists her son is innocent.\n",
      "A tough stance on immigration was a central plank of Trump's re-election campaign, and the president has used his broad powers of enforcement to deliver that pledge.\n",
      "Illegal border crossings were falling at the end of the Biden presidency, but are now at their lowest monthly total for more than four years.\n",
      "A majority of the US public still backs the crackdown, but it has had a chilling effect on communities of foreign students who have found themselves caught up in the blitz.\n",
      "Some, including permanent residents, have been detained and face deportation because of their role in pro-Palestinian campus protests. They have rejected accusations that they support Hamas.\n",
      "Civil rights lawyers warn that some migrants are being deported without due process, sweeping up the innocent among the \"killers and thugs\" that Trump says are being targeted.\n",
      "While so far there haven't been the level of mass deportations that some hoped for and others feared, newly empowered immigration enforcement agents have taken action across the US in businesses, homes and churches.\n",
      "They have been active in universities too, which have become a prominent target of President Trump in several other ways.\n",
      "On 21 April, Harvard University's president, Alan Garber, decided to confront the White House head-on.\n",
      "In a letter to the university community, he announced a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration's move to freeze billions of dollars in federal grants.\n",
      "It was, he said, an illegal attempt to \"impose unprecedented and improper control\" over Harvard's operations.\n",
      "The White House said it had to take action because Harvard had not tackled antisemitism on campus - an issue that Garber said the university was taking steps to address.\n",
      "But the Ivy League college's move was the most prominent display of resistance against Trump's use of presidential power to target American higher education, a longstanding goal energised by pro-Palestinian protests that engulfed campuses in 2024.\n",
      "The president and his officials have since impounded or threatened to withhold billions of dollars in federal spending to reshape elite institutions like Harvard, which the president and many of his supporters think push a liberal ideology on students and researchers.\n",
      "Earlier in the month, Columbia University in New York City had agreed to a number of White House demands, including changes to its protest policies, campus security practices and Middle Eastern studies department.\n",
      "A similar dynamic has played out in the corporate and media worlds.\n",
      "Trump has used the withholding of federal contracts as a way to pressure law firms to recruit and represent more conservatives.\n",
      "Some of the firms have responded by offering the Trump administration millions of dollars in free legal services, while two firms have filed suit challenging the constitutionality of the administration's punishments.\n",
      "A defamation lawsuit Trump brought against ABC News has led to the media company contributing $15m (£11m) to Trump's presidential foundation.\n",
      "CBS is also in talks to settle a separate lawsuit over a Kamala Harris interview, as its parent company Paramount seeks federal approval for a merger with Skydance Media.\n",
      "The Associated Press, by contrast, has resisted administration pressure to accept Trump's \"Gulf of America\" name change despite the White House's efforts to block the news agency from coverage of the president.\n",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump warned about the runaway power of the federal government. Now in office, he is wielding that power in a way no previous modern president has attempted.\n",
      "Nowhere, however, have the impacts of his efforts been more visible than within the federal government agencies and departments that he now controls.\n",
      "The press conference at the White House began with a moment's silence for the victims of an aircraft collision over the Potomac River.\n",
      "Within seconds of the pause coming to an end, however, Trump was on the attack.\n",
      "A diversity and inclusion initiative at the Federal Aviation Agency was partly to blame for the tragedy, the president claimed, because it hired people with severe intellectual disabilities as air traffic controllers. He did not provide any evidence.\n",
      "It was a startling moment that was emblematic of the attack his presidency has launched against inclusivity programmes that have proliferated in recent years across the US government and corporate world.\n",
      "Trump has directed the federal government to end its diversity and equity (DEI) programmes and investigate private companies and academic institutions thought to be engaged in \"illegal DEI\".\n",
      "His directive has accelerated moves among leading global companies like Meta and Goldman to cut back or eliminate these programmes.\n",
      "First introduced in the 1960s in the wake of civil rights victories, early forms of DEI were an attempt to expand opportunities for black Americans. They later expanded to take in women, LGBT rights and other racial groups.\n",
      "Efforts were stepped up and embraced by much of corporate America in the wake of the 2020 Black Lives Matters protests following the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis Police officers.\n",
      "But to its critics, DEI was putting politics and race above talent, creating division and was no longer needed in modern America.\n",
      "While Trump's directive seems to have support from a narrow majority of voters, some of the unexpected consequences have raised eyebrows.\n",
      "Arlington National Cemetery scrubbed from its website all mentions of the history of black and female service members. And the Enola Gay aircraft that dropped an atomic bomb on Japan was initially flagged for removal from Pentagon documents, apparently due to the word \"gay\".\n",
      "Donald Trump's first 100 days have been an unprecedented display of unilateral power exercised by a modern American president.\n",
      "His efforts to dismantle large swaths of the federal government will take years, if not decades, for subsequent presidents to restore - if they so desire.\n",
      "In other ways, however, Trump's efforts so far may end up being less permanent. Without the support of new laws passed by Congress, many of his sweeping reforms could be wiped away by a future president.\n",
      "And so to what extent this whirlwind start leads to lasting change remains an open question.\n",
      "Later this year, the narrow Republican majorities in Congress will attempt to provide the legislative backing for Trump's agenda, but their success is far from guaranteed.\n",
      "And in next year's mid-term congressional elections, those majorities could be replaced by hostile Democrats bent on investigating the administration and curtailing his authority.\n",
      "Meanwhile, more court battles loom - and while the US Supreme Court has a conservative tilt, its decisions on a number of key cases could ultimately cut against Trump's efforts.\n",
      "The first 100 days of Trump's second term have been a dramatic show of political force, but the next 1,361 will be the real test of whether he can carve an enduring legacy.\n",
